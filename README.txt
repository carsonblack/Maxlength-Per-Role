This module allows administrators to set maximum lengths for the body and CCK text fields of content types on a per role basis. It works hand in hand with the maxlength module. The Maxlength module is required, and I pretty much stole the structure from that module to create this one. At some point this could probably be incorporated into the Maxlength module.

Any questions or problems please use the issue queue via the project page
